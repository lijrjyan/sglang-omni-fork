# Qwen3-Omni

[Qwen3-Omni](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct) is a multi-modal model
that accepts text, image, audio, and video input and can produce text-only or text + audio output.
This page covers every supported server configuration — use the generator to get the exact launch
command for your hardware, then check the tables to confirm your combination is supported.

## Compatibility Matrix

Colocated topology requires `--config examples/configs/qwen3_omni_colocated_h20.yaml`
(or `qwen3_omni_colocated_h200.yaml` on H200) to set per-stage GPU memory budgets.

## Input / Output Modalities

All input modality combinations work with both text-only and speech servers.
`modalities: ["text", "audio"]` requires a **speech-mode server** (omit `--text-only`).

| Input | Output | Speech server | Minimal request body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "modalities": ["text"]}` | — |
| Image + text | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "images": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | — |
| Audio | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "audios": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | content must be "" when the query is spoken |
| Image + audio | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "images": ["path/or/url"], "audios": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | content must be "" when the query is spoken |
| Image | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "images": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | content must be "" when query comes from image |
| Video + text | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "videos": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | — |
| Video + audio | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "videos": ["path/or/url"], "audios": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | content must be "" when the query is spoken |
| Video | Text | No | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "videos": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text"]}` | content must be "" when query comes from video |
| Text | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | — |
| Image + text | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "images": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | — |
| Audio | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "audios": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | content must be "" when the query is spoken |
| Image + audio | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "images": ["path/or/url"], "audios": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | content must be "" when the query is spoken |
| Image | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "images": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | content must be "" when query comes from image |
| Video + text | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}], "videos": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | — |
| Video + audio | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "videos": ["path/or/url"], "audios": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | content must be "" when the query is spoken |
| Video | Text + Audio | **Yes** | `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}], "videos": ["path/or/url"], "modalities": ["text", "audio"]}` | content must be "" when query comes from video |

### Sampling Parameters

Standard sampling parameters apply to the thinker stage. When `modalities` includes `"audio"`, the additional talker-specific parameters below control the speech generation independently.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `temperature` | float | `1.0` | Thinker |
| `top_p` | float | `1.0` | Thinker |
| `top_k` | int | `-1` | Thinker |
| `min_p` | float | `0.0` | Thinker |
| `repetition_penalty` | float | `1.0` | Thinker |
| `max_tokens` | int | `2048` | Thinker |
| `max_completion_tokens` | int | `null` | Thinker; OpenAI-compatible alias for `max_tokens` |
| `stop` | str \| list | `null` | Thinker |
| `seed` | int | `null` | Thinker |
| `stream` | bool | `false` | Both |
| `audio` | dict | `null` | Speech response format config, e.g. `{"format": "wav"}` |
| `talker_temperature` | float | `0.9` | Talker (audio output only) |
| `talker_top_p` | float | `1.0` | Talker (audio output only) |
| `talker_top_k` | int | `50` | Talker (audio output only) |
| `talker_repetition_penalty` | float | `1.05` | Talker (audio output only) |
| `talker_max_new_tokens` | int | `4096` | Talker (audio output only) |
| `stage_sampling` | dict | `null` | Per-stage sampling override |
| `stage_params` | dict | `null` | Per-stage non-sampling params |
| `video_fps` | float | `null` | Frame sampling rate for video input (uses server default if unset) |
| `video_max_frames` | int | `null` | Maximum number of frames sampled from a video |
| `video_min_pixels` | int | `null` | Minimum pixels per video frame |
| `video_max_pixels` | int | `null` | Maximum pixels per video frame |
| `video_total_pixels` | int | `null` | Total pixel budget across all video frames |

### Known Limitations

- **`modalities: ["text", "audio"]` has no effect on a text-only server.** No error is raised — the response simply contains no audio. Use a speech-mode server (without `--text-only`) to get audio output.
- **`content` must be `""` when the query is entirely in `audios`, `videos`, or `images`.** Leaving a text query in `content` alongside audio causes the model to process both, which is usually not what you want.
- **Colocated topology does not support `--thinker.tp_size 2`.** The server raises a `ValueError` at startup ("Qwen Phase 1 colocation does not support thinker TP"). Use disaggregated topology for TP=2.
- **Requests that exceed the model's context length are rejected with an error.** The preprocessor raises a `ValueError` when the prompt token count alone meets or exceeds `max_seq_len`, or when `prompt tokens + max_new_tokens ≥ max_seq_len`. Reduce input length or lower `max_tokens` to stay within the limit.

## Speculative Decoding (text-only thinker)

The text-only thinker can run SGLang's native EAGLE3 or DFlash draft workers
(`sglang.srt.speculative`) without any patch to SGLang. Omni owns the draft
configuration, worker bootstrap, the synchronous scheduler lane, and the
Qwen3-Omni prefill hook that hands the composed audio/image embeddings to the
draft-extend step; SGLang owns drafting, verification, and graph replay.

Public drafts trained on target-regenerated ASR labels:

| Draft | Algorithm | Serve with |
|---|---|---|
| `yuekai/qwen3_omni_30b_a3b_instruct_eagle3_audio` | EAGLE3 | `speculative_num_steps: 3`, `speculative_num_draft_tokens: 4` |
| `yuekai/qwen3_omni_30b_a3b_instruct_dflash_block8` | DFLASH | `speculative_num_draft_tokens: 8` (the draft's block size) |

```yaml
config_cls: Qwen3OmniPipelineConfig
model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
stages:
  thinker:
    engine:
      max_running_requests: 8
    factory:
      enable_speculative: true
      speculative_algorithm: EAGLE3
      speculative_draft_model_path: yuekai/qwen3_omni_30b_a3b_instruct_eagle3_audio
      speculative_num_steps: 3
      speculative_num_draft_tokens: 4
      speculative_cuda_graph: true
```

```bash
sgl-omni serve --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --config spec.yaml --text-only
```

Constraints:

- Text-only pipeline only (`--text-only`); the speech pipeline's talker stays
  non-speculative.
- The thinker runs the synchronous lane: async decode, prefill admission
  coalescing, mixed prefill/decode chunks, and prefill CUDA graphs are turned
  off. `speculative_cuda_graph: true` captures the target verify graph.
  `speculative_draft_cuda_graph: true` additionally captures draft decode;
  false keeps draft decode eager. EAGLE3 draft-extend capture follows the
  attention backend's support independently.
- `speculative_eagle_topk` is fixed at 1; EAGLE3 requires
  `speculative_num_draft_tokens == speculative_num_steps + 1`.
- Visual deepstack prefills (image/video input) are not supported in the
  speculative lane and are rejected before thinker request construction;
  audio and text input are.
- ASR drafts are prompt- and domain-sensitive: accept length is measured with
  the draft's training prompt (`Transcribe the English audio into text.`).

For greedy comparisons, you can test
`thinker.engine.enable_deterministic_inference: true` in both the speculative
and non-speculative configurations. This uses SGLang's batch-invariant kernels
and can increase latency. Compare exact outputs with matching settings; enabling
this only for the draft-assisted run does not make an ordinary baseline a
bit-identical oracle.
This setting does not guarantee exact speculative/non-speculative parity for
the complete multimodal pipeline: concurrent audio requests can still differ.
